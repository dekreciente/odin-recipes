    <p>Simple, flavorful, comforting!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>2 pounds carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
            <li>14 ounces water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour the vegetable broth into a soup pot, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Stir in the curry powder, cumin, cinnamon, and ginger; add the carrots. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the carrots are tender, about 20 minutes, stirring often.</li>
            <li>Strain out the carrots from the broth, and place carrots into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Pour about 1/4 cup vegetable broth into the blender to allow the carrots to puree. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the carrots moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth, if needed; return the pureed carrots to the vegetable broth. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the carrots right in the cooking pot.</li>
            <li>Stir in the coconut milk and the water (use the coconut milk can to measure). Bring back to a simmer; sprinkle with cilantro to serve.</li>
        </ol>
